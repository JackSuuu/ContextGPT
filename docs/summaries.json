These core capacities are monitored through an average of **35 indicators** measuring 15 critical capacities. The implementation status of these capacities improved slightly, with the global average rising from **64% in 2021 to 66% in 2022** across all WHO regions. This framework ensures countries are prepared to detect, assess, and respond to health threats, emphasizing accountability and progress tracking under the IHR. \n\nNo other explicit \"Requirement\" sections are identified in the provided context.", "Kinds of Requirements": "The provided context does not explicitly include a section titled \"Kinds of Requirements.\" However, based on the content, it discusses **health-related metrics, data types, and legal obligations** under the International Health Regulations (IHR). Here's a concise summary of relevant elements that might align with \"requirements\":\n\n1. **IHR Core Capacities**:  \n   - Countries are required to develop and maintain core public health capacities (e.g., surveillance, response) under the IHR.  \n   - Progress is tracked via **35 indicators** across 15 core capacities.  \n   - Average implementation status improved from **64% (2021) to 66% (2022)** globally.  \n\n2. **Data Requirements**:  \n   - Metrics include adolescent birth rates, household health expenditures, mortality rates (e.g., air pollution, poisoning), and UHC service coverage.  \n   - Data types: **Comparable estimates** (modeled/normalized data) and **primary data** (direct country-reported data).  \n\n3. **Challenges**:  \n   - Sparse data and lack of tracking mechanisms (e.g., for medication access disruptions during COVID-19).  \n\nIf the actual \"Kinds of Requirements\" section is not fully represented here, additional context may be needed for a precise summary.", "Requirements vs. Design": "The provided context does not include a section titled \"Requirements vs. Design.\" The content visible in the excerpts primarily consists of disclaimers, credits (e.g., design/layout by Agence Gardeners), a table of contents, and data-related sections listing health metrics (e.g., alcohol consumption, mortality rates, family planning indicators) with their respective data types (\"comparable estimates\" or \"primary data\"). \n\nIf the \"Requirements vs. Design\" section exists in the full document, it is not included in the context provided here. For further assistance, please verify the document's structure or share additional excerpts that explicitly mention this section.", "Stakeholders in Requirements": "The provided context does not include a specific section titled \"Stakeholders in Requirements\" or explicit details about stakeholders related to requirements in the document. The text focuses on climate change and health initiatives (e.g., WHO's ATACH), barriers to implementing national health and climate plans (e.g., insufficient funding), and statistical data from the *World Health Statistics 2023* report.  \n\nIf you are referring to stakeholders in the context of climate-resilient health systems, the document mentions **countries** (over 60 committed to the ATACH initiative), **WHO**, and organizations like the OECD and Global Polio Eradication Initiative as data sources.
