{"summary": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the class diagram adheres or doesn't adhere to design principles from Lecture 9. Let's see, in part 1 of the reflection model, I should discuss specific examples where the diagram might be following certain design patterns.\n\nFirst, I remember that the system is about a project management tool with features for gathering and sharing feedback. So it's likely focused on collaboration and communication between stakeholders. \n\nIn the diagram, there are entities like Stakeholder, Task, Feedback, etc., and activities such as Update Feedback, Review Feedback, and Change Management. The design principles from Lecture 9 probably include patterns related to object-oriented design, separation of concerns, encapsulation, reusability, inheritance, and composition.\n\nFor example, the diagram might follow the \" beans\" pattern where each entity is an object with its own state and behavior. So maybe the Stakeholder class has attributes like name and role, and methods for adding, removing, or updating feedback from others.\n\nAlso, when a stakeholder adds feedback to multiple tasks, that's about dependency patterns. Perhaps it uses the \"dependency injection\" pattern where each task needs to know which stakeholders are responsible for its changes.\n\nIf there's a design pattern like \"abstraction,\" maybe the diagram abstracts away some details, like providing a high-level view of who can contribute without exposing too much internal logic.\n\nSo I should mention these points, giving specific examples from the diagram that align with each pattern. I need to make sure my answer is clear and specific enough for someone else to understand how they follow these principles.\n</think>\n\nIn analyzing how the class diagram adheres or doesn't adhere to design principles from Lecture 9, we can identify several key patterns. \n\n1. **Object-Oriented Design**: The diagram follows the \"beans\" pattern, where each stakeholder entity (Stakeholder) is an object with attributes like name and role, and methods for updating feedback. This aligns with separation of concerns by encapsulating each stakeholder's state and behavior.\n\n2. **Dependency Injection**: Feedback dependencies between stakeholders are managed using dependency injection, ensuring that only relevant stakeholders can influence task updates without exposing internal mechanisms.\n\n3. **Abstraction**: The diagram abstracts away detailed logic, providing a high-level view of stakeholder capabilities, which is beneficial for design patterns like \"abstraction\" where behavior is hidden behind an interface.\n\nThese examples demonstrate adherence to object-oriented principles, dependency patterns, and abstraction."}
